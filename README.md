# Ackemon 
Ackemon is a card game written in Java using Swing graphics for the GUI. It contains monster cards and enhancement cards. 
The cards have different types that affect their effectiveness on other cards.
This was my first large coding project, written in the Spring of 2018 for my Object Oriented Programming class.
As such, the code is messy and the game is buggy. I may go back and work on this later, but it is unlikely.
